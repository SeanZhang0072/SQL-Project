What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.
1. Data Consistency: Look for inconsistencies or discrepancies in data patterns, values, or relationships.
2. Missing Values: Identify columns or fields with a high number of missing or null values.
3. Data Integrity: Check for duplicate records, invalid or inconsistent data formats, or data logic issues.
4. Outliers: Identify extreme or unexpected values that could affect the accuracy of results.
5. Data Dependencies: Understand the relationships and dependencies between different data tables or columns.


QA Process:
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.
1. Define QA Standards: Identify which data is usable and which data needs cleaning. For example, check if the data is duplicated, if there are any null values, or if the formats are correct.
2. Develop a Data Adjustment Plan: Based on the QA standards, make plans on how to handle the data. Communicate with business teams or data users to understand the context in which the data is used. For example, decide whether to delete duplicate data, how to handle null values, and how to change data formats.
3. Execute Data Quality Checks: Use SQL queries to address the data, performing delete, replace, and modify operations.
4. Review and Analyze Results: Analyze the data after processing and check if it meets the expected standards. Record all findings for future reference.
5. Iterate Until Satisfied: If the data doesn't meet the standards, reconsider the data handling strategies, and repeat the data quality checks until the results are satisfactory.

Here are some query examples that I used during the QA process:

1. check for duplicate records
   
select fullVisitorId, count(*) from all_sessions
group by fullVisitorId
having count(*) > 1
order by count(*) desc

2. check for missing values in a column

select channelgrouping from all_sessions
where channelgrouping is null

3. replace missing values

UPDATE all_sessions
SET totalTransactionRevenue = COALESCE(totalTransactionRevenue, 0)
WHERE totalTransactionRevenue IS NULL

4. fix the datatype

alter table all_sessions add column newtime time
UPDATE all_sessions SET newtime = '00:00'::time + time * '1 second'::interval
ALTER TABLE all_sessions DROP COLUMN time
ALTER TABLE all_sessions RENAME COLUMN newtime TO time

5. Changing Data Formats

UPDATE analytics
SET date = TO_DATE(date, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
