# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This project involves cleaning and analyzing data from multiple tables in a database, possibly related to e-commerce transactions and customer sessions. The main goal of this project is to ensure that the data is clean, well-structured and reliable for further analysis. The secondary objective is to analyze the cleaned data for trends, insights, and correlations, which are useful for business decision-making and strategic planning.

## Process
### Step 1: Data Cleaning
a. Inspected all the columns of the table "all_sessions" and made necessary modifications such as transforming time into a readable format, handling null values, and deleting irrelevant columns.
b. Examined the table "analytics" for consistency and validity. Removed redundant columns and handled improper data types and values.
c. Verified the integrity and cleanliness of other tables like "products," "public.sales_by_sku," and "public.sales_report."

### Step 2: Data Analysis and Interpretation
After cleaning the data, the next step was analyzing the data to derive insights and answer questions. Some of these questions were predefined at the beginning of the project. For example:

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
