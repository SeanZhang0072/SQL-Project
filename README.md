# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This project involves cleaning and analyzing data from multiple tables in a database, possibly related to e-commerce transactions and customer sessions. The main goal of this project is to ensure that the data is clean, well-structured and reliable for further analysis. The secondary objective is to analyze the cleaned data for trends, insights, and correlations, which are useful for business decision-making and strategic planning.

## Process
### Step 1: Data Cleaning
a. Inspected all the columns of the table "all_sessions" and made necessary modifications such as transforming time into a readable format, handling null values, and deleting irrelevant columns.
b. Examined the table "analytics" for consistency and validity. Removed redundant columns and handled improper data types and values.
c. Verified the integrity and cleanliness of other tables like "products," "public.sales_by_sku," and "public.sales_report."

### Step 2: Interpretation
After cleaning the data, the next step was using the data to derive insights and answer questions. Some of these questions were predefined at the beginning of the project. For example:
Which cities and countries have the highest level of transaction revenues on the site?
What is the average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?
In addition to answering predefined questions, the data analysis also led to the formulation of new questions based on the insights gained.

### Step 3: Data Analysis
In the process of dealing with problem-solving and problem-discovery, we should perform a series of key steps. 
a. First, it is crucial to perform exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and trends in the data, as this can give us insight into the nature of the data. 
b. Next, we need to analyze the relationship between the different variables, which can reveal potential correlations and causal relationships and lay the groundwork for in-depth analysis. 
c. Finally, creating visual charts and dashboards is critical to better understanding and presenting the information. Not only does this allow us to visualize the data more intuitively, but it also makes it easier to communicate our findings to others. 
By integrating these three steps, we can analyze data more comprehensively and provide a solid basis for making informed decisions.
