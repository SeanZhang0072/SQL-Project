# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This project involves cleaning and analyzing data from multiple tables in a database, possibly related to e-commerce transactions and customer sessions. The main goal of this project is to ensure that the data is clean, well-structured, and reliable for further analysis. The secondary objective is to analyze the cleaned data for trends, insights, and correlations, which are useful for business decision-making and strategic planning.

## Process
### Step 1: Data Cleaning
a. Inspected all the columns of the table "all_sessions" and made necessary modifications such as transforming time into a readable format, handling null values, and deleting irrelevant columns.
b. Examined the table "analytics" for consistency and validity. Removed redundant columns and handled improper data types and values.
c. Verified the integrity and cleanliness of other tables like "products," "public.sales_by_sku," and "public.sales_report."

### Step 2: Interpretation
After cleaning the data, the next step was using the data to derive insights and answer questions. Some of these questions were predefined at the beginning of the project. For example:
Which cities and countries have the highest level of transaction revenues on the site?
What is the average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?
In addition to answering predefined questions, the data analysis also led to the formulation of new questions based on the insights gained.

### Step 3: Data Analysis
In the process of dealing with problem-solving and problem-discovery, we should perform a series of key steps. 
a. First, it is crucial to perform exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and trends in the data, as this can give us insight into the nature of the data. 
b. Next, we need to analyze the relationship between the different variables, which can reveal potential correlations and causal relationships and lay the groundwork for in-depth analysis. 
c. Finally, creating visual charts and dashboards is critical to better understanding and presenting the information. Not only does this allow us to visualize the data more intuitively, but it also makes it easier to communicate our findings to others. 
By integrating these three steps, we can analyze data more comprehensively and provide a solid basis for making informed decisions.

## Results
The data analysis yielded valuable insights into user behavior, sales trends, and product performance. Some of the findings included:

Identifying popular products and categories.
Understanding customer preferences in different cities and countries.
Understanding the impact of different marketing channels on sales.
Gaining insights into user engagement based on time spent on the site, page views, etc.

These insights enabled informed decision-making, strategy optimization, and performance improvement.

## Challenges 
1. Handling large volumes of data and ensuring data processing efficiency.
2. Dealing with missing or incomplete data which could lead to skewed analysis.
3. Understanding and interpreting complex relationships within the data.
4. Not having practical business experience, which leads to confusion regarding the meanings of certain column names in the tables.
5. Feeling at a loss when encountering crucial data that is mostly null or missing.

## Future Goals
If more time were available, the future goals would include:

1. Implementing more advanced statistical and machine learning models to predict user behavior and sales trends. This would allow me to address the challenge of understanding complex relationships within the data, and make more informed interpretations.
2. Creating a more interactive and dynamic dashboard for real-time data monitoring. A user-friendly interface would be invaluable for someone like me who might be initially puzzled by the significance of certain column names in the tables. The interactive aspect would also allow me to explore the data more intuitively, possibly mitigating the issue of dealing with large volumes of data.
3. Integrating the dataset with additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis. This could help in filling the gaps for the crucial data that I found to be mostly null or missing. By combining information from multiple sources, it might be possible to gain a more complete picture and make more robust decisions.
